	###### Gamification in Classes ########
=============
We all need some motivation once in a while, especially when it comes to handing in all the assessments and essays on time. Gamification is when game mechanics and game designs are applied in non-game contexts to engage and motivate people to achieve their goals. 
	

I believe that gamifying classes would lead to more motivation and better achievements throughout the school year. Gamification in classes prompts the engagement and the participation of the students, which leads to better understanding of the subject and to a healthy competition between the students. 
	

 Unfortunately, most of my classes are not gamified and sometimes I find it hard to follow the material, know all the due dates and hand everything on time. I suggest having a shared timeline for each module, the timeline should consist of the module timetable, due dates of assignments, reading material and the grades. When doing an assignment on time or before hand, one will have the option of ticking in the box and gaining more points for following up with the assignments and reading material which will give a feeling of rewarding. The timeline should also highlight the 10% deducted points of each late submission assignments and point how many assignments one handed in late. 
 	
 
Moreover, the grade of each assignment would show how the student is progressing throughout the module. I believe that the grades should be individual and personal, because every one should be motivated by his own progress. However, a visual timeline for who did the readings and who handed in the assignments on time should be publicly shared in order to motivate one another.
